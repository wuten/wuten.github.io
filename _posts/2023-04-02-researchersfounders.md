## Researchers and Founders

1. Although there are always individual exceptions, on average it’s surprising to me **how different the best people in these groups are** (including in some qualities that I had assumed were present in great people everywhere, like very high levels of self-belief).
   虽然总有个别例外，但总体而言，**这群最优秀的人之间的差异之大令我感到惊讶**（包括我认为任何地方的伟大人物都具备的一些品质，比如非常高的自信心）

2. So I’ve been thinking about the ways they’re the same, because maybe **there is something to learn about qualities of really effective people** in general.
   所以我一直在思考他们的相同之处，因为也许**我们可以从真正有效率的人身上学到一些东西**。

3. **The best people in both groups spend a lot of time reflecting on some version of the Hamming question**—"what are the most important problems in your field, and why aren’t you working on them?” In general, no one reflects on this question enough, but the best people do it the most, and have the best ‘problem taste’, which is some combination of **learning to think independently**, **reason about the future**, and **identify attack vectors**. [This from John Schulman is worth reading](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html).
    **两组中最优秀的人都会花很多时间思考汉明问题的某个版本**--“你所在领域最重要的问题是什么，你为什么不去解决它们？”一般来说，没有人会对这个问题进行足够的反思，但最优秀的人做得最多，并且拥有最好的“问题品味”，这是学习独立思考、推理未来和识别攻击向量的某种组合。[This约翰·舒尔曼的话值得阅读](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html)。

4. They have **a laser focus on the next step in front of them combined with long-term vision**. Most people only have one or the other.
他们**专注于结合长远目光的当下**。大多数人只有一个或另一个。

5. **They are extremely persistent and willing to work hard**.
   As far as I can tell, there is no high-probability way to be very successful without this,
   and you should be suspicious of people who tell you otherwise unless you’d be happy having their career (and be especially suspicious if they worked hard themselves).
他们非常执着，愿意努力工作。据我所知，如果没有这一点，就没有成功的高概率途径，你应该怀疑那些告诉你相反情况的人，除非你对他们的职业感到高兴（如果他们自己努力工作，你应该特别怀疑）。

6. They have a bias towards action and trying things, and they’re clear-eyed and honest about what is working and what isn’t (importantly, this goes both ways—I’m amazed by how many people will see something working and then not pursue it).
他们倾向于行动和尝试，他们对什么是有效的，什么是无效的都很清楚和诚实（重要的是，这是双向的--我很惊讶**有多少人会看到一些东西有效，然后不去追求它**）

7. **They are creative idea-generators—a lot of the ideas** may be terrible, but there is never a shortage.
他们是创造性想法的产生者--很多想法可能很糟糕，但从来都不缺乏。

8. **They really value autonomy and have a hard time with rules that they don’t think make sense.** They are definitely not lemmings.
他们真的很重视自主权，很难遵守他们认为没有意义的规则。他们绝对不是旅鼠。

9. **Their motivations are often more complex than they seem—specifically**, they are frequently very **driven by genuine curiosity.**
他们的动机往往比表面上看起来要复杂得多，特别是，他们经常受到真正的好奇心的驱使。
